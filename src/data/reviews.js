      'Great Experience with the Team at Sunny’s Gameroom. I was impressed and I had no idea a pool table could be disassembled and reassembled so thoroughly- and they were being super careful and diligent too ! Professional and knowledgeable!!! Definitely looking forward to using the company for future pool table projects.'

      'I used these guys to deliver a pool table from a private sell and I am incredibly happy with the service provided. They communicated with me and the original seller and arrived quickly within their given time window. All of my pool table pieces were carefully wrapped and they also provided the best price I could find.\n\nHighly recommend.'

      "I'm a pool novice but an experienced businessperson. These guys do business and communicate the way it should be done. Can't recommend them too highly.\nFound them on Craigslist while looking for a quality used table, but I was leery given previous Craiglist experience. Their ad mentioned a small inventory of used tables in about my price range. My inquiry to Dylan, one of the owners. was promptly answered, with sufficient information for me to do my own research on the tables available. I selected one, and asked if I could take a look at it, despite it having already been knocked down and in the warehouse. \"No problem\" said Dylan, and at the exact agreed time he met me at the warehouse and ran through all the details. He also explained the options for the new felt, and agreed that for me as a novice the felt did not need to be 'tournament grade.\" (Despite that, I later learned that their 'basic' felt replacement is actually a good deal better than most low-end pool felts.) We agreed on an install date, and I was told an approximate time, and was notified when he and his crew were on their way within that time window. Upon arrival, Dylan suggested the best placement for the table, and the install proceeded. Every step of the way he and his crew were meticulous and explained the little details, and it became evident that Dylan was a real pro, artisan and expert, shimming where needed, stretching with just the right amount of tension on the felt, tightened and loosening as called for, etc. He knows his business.\nIn summary, I could not have been more pleased with the entire process. If you're in need of pool table services, or in the market for a high quality used table, call them first."

      "This team is fantastic! They were not only very professional, but helpful when things on my end went sideways, offering advice and being very responsive to all of my questions. They returned calls and texts quickly, and got my pool table moved well ahead of schedule. I can't say enough good things about them!"
